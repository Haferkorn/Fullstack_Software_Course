Hi there!

After a Bachelor Degree in Computer Science with a focus on music technology and during my Master degree in Media Informatics, I'm intensively learning to code and interested in data science, software engineering and web design aiming to be hired in 2022. This repository is for completed projects and code snippets from Codecademy Fullstack engineer career path and Freecodecamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures. 

With this two paths, I'm learning, practicing and successfully applied following skills & topics:

- Command Line Commands
- Git
- JavaScript (repo: [Javascript Algorithms and Dats Structures](https://github.com/Haferkorn/Fullstack_Software_Course/tree/main/Javascript_Algo_Data) )
- HTML
- CSS
- Accessiblity
- Test Driven Development with JavaScript
- Async JavaScript and HTTP Requests
- React
- Redux
- Back-End with Node/Express.js
- Back-End and Feature Testing
- SQL for Back-End Development
- PostgreSQL Database
- Designing Relational Databases
- Security, Authentication, and Authorization

List of projects:

Hurricane Analysis Challenge Project (Python): This project aimed to use the basics of Python programming (dictionaries, loops, conditionals, etc.) to analyze data and put it into context.



Hope this repo will help you to assess my coding skills or will be just fun for you to play with.
